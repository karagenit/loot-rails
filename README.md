# Loot

D&D Party Loot Splitter

Master List of Items
- Delete
- New
  - Name
  - Sale Price
- Take

Player's List of Items (each has budget to be used on items or just to draw out cash)
- Drop

Cash Accounts (Gains/Losses)
- player option to take cash out for themselves or to put cash in, to balance personal accounts

To Be Sold (adds to cash accounts)

Could we have it sync with the backend? Store the master list with a certain URL (/loot/ASFDm384cm/) so everybody can edit at once?
